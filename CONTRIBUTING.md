# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest with Soul!

To contribute, please familiarize yourself with the ways to do so presented below.

## Code contributions

As of 23 Oct 2025, Soul is in its **pre-alpha** stage of development.

Sadly, we are not looking for individual contributions at this point, here are the current blockers:

* We do not have any license chosen for this project yet.
* Internal API is not stable, and may (and will) change at any moment.

Until these matters are resolved any code contributions are impossible at the very least.
